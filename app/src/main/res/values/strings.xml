    <string name="desc1"><b>Soil</b>\n\n

        Well drained soil rich in organic matter, but with no manure added prior to planting.
        Use well aged compost or vermicompost to condition compacted soil.\n\n<b>Position</b>\n\n
        Sun or partial afternoon shade.\n\n<b>Frost tolerant</b>\n\nTops tolerate light frost; roots survive hard freezes.
        \n\n<b>Feeding</b>\n\nSoil quality is more essential that supplemental feeding.
        \n\n<b>Harvesting</b>\n\nCan be harvested over a long period, but the longer plants are left in the ground,
        the more likely they are to be injured by insects or animals.Pull them from the soil when the roots are 1 to 1Â½ inches in diameter.
        To avoid breaking the carrot while pulling, loosen the soil around the carrot with a spade. </string>
